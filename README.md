How to get started with django and celery ? 

# create virtualenv and activate it.
# install the following stuff,
```
pip install django
pip install django-celery
```

# create django project 
# add following apps to INSTALLED_APPS
```
'djcelery',
'kombu.transport.django',
```
   
   <b>djcelery is always needed. kombu.transport.django is the Django-based broker, for use mainly during development.</b>
   
# add followoing code to settings.py
```
import djcelery
djcelery.setup_loader()
BROKER_URL = 'django://'
```
  <b>The first two lines are always needed. Line 3 configures Celery to use its Django broker.
  Important: Never use the Django broker in production. We are only using it here to save time in this tutorial.     In production you'll want to use RabbitMQ, or maybe Redis.</b>
  
  and also add this line to settings.py, 
  
```
CELERY_IMPORTS=("demo.tasks")
```
  
# now create tables,

```
python manage.py migrate
```
  
# create new file in demo folder as ```task.py``` and add following code to it,

```
from celery import task
@task()
  def add(x, y):
  return x + y
```
    
# open another terminal and execute following line (*) ,

```
python manage.py celery worker --loglevel=info
```

 **keep it running.**
    
# open django shell and try the following code,
```
(env1)âžœ  demo  ./manage.py shell
